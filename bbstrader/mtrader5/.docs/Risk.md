# Risk Management Class Documentation

The `RiskManagement` class extends the functionalities of the `Account` class, focusing on essential risk management tasks for trading on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It calculates risk levels, sets stop loss and take profit levels based on predefined parameters, and ensures that trading activities are within acceptable risk boundaries.

## Dependencies
- Inherits from `Account` class in `mtrader5.account`
- `mtrader5.rates`: For accessing market rate information
- `MetaTrader5 (Mt5)`: The MetaTrader 5 integration package
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `scipy.stats`: For statistical functions, specifically `norm` for normal distribution calculations
- `datetime`: For handling dates and times
- `time`, `random`, `re`: For miscellaneous operations

## Class: RiskManagement

### Description
`RiskManagement` is designed to incorporate risk management strategies into automated trading algorithms. It offers functionality to calculate risk exposure, determine appropriate lot sizes based on risk, and calculate stop loss and take profit levels dynamically.

### Initialization
The constructor initializes the `RiskManagement` class with various risk parameters and trading settings.

#### Parameters
- `symbol (str)`: Financial instrument symbol.
- `max_risk (float)`: Maximum risk allowed on the trading account as a percentage of equity.
- `daily_risk (float)`: Daily maximum risk allowed as a percentage of equity.
- `max_trades (int)`: Maximum number of trades allowed in a trading session.
- `std_stop (bool)`: Determines if stop loss is calculated based on historical volatility.
- `pchange_sl (float)`: Determines stop loss based on percentage change of the trading instrument.
- `account_leverage (bool)`: Indicates whether account leverage is used in risk management.
- `time_frame (str)`: Time frame for trading strategies.
- `start_time (str)`: Start time for trading strategies.
- `finishing_time (str)`: End time for trading strategies.
- `sl (int)`: Stop Loss in points.
- `tp (int)`: Take Profit in points.
- `be (int)`: Break Even in points.

### Methods

#### `risk_level`
Calculates the current risk level of the account based on open trades and account balance.

#### `get_lot`
Determines the appropriate lot size for a trade, considering the account's risk tolerance and the financial instrument's characteristics.

#### `max_trade`
Calculates the maximum number of trades allowed within the specified time frame, based on the trading session's duration and the specified time frame for trades.

#### `get_minutes`, `get_hours`
Utility methods to calculate the number of minutes and hours between the trading session's start and end times.

#### `get_stop_loss`
Calculates the stop loss for a trade in points. It can use a fixed value, standard deviation-based calculation, or percentage change-based calculation.

#### `get_std_stop`
Calculates a standard deviation-based stop loss level for a financial instrument.

#### `get_pchange_stop`
Determines a percentage change-based stop loss level for a financial instrument.

#### `calculate_var`, `var_cov_var`
Computes the Value at Risk (VaR) for the trading account, using the variance-covariance method.

#### `var_loss_value`
Calculates the stop-loss level based on Value at Risk (VaR).

#### `get_take_profit`
Determines the take profit level for a trade in points.

#### `get_currency_risk`
Calculates the currency risk of a trade, expressed in the account's base currency.

#### `expected_profit`
Estimates the expected profit per trade based on take profit levels and trade characteristics.

#### `volume`
Calculates the trade volume based on lot size and contract specifications.

#### `currency_risk`
Computes various risk metrics for a trade, including currency risk, trade loss, trade profit, volume, and lot size.

#### `get_trade_risk`
Calculates the risk per trade as a percentage of the account's equity.

#### `get_leverage`
Determines the effective leverage for a trade, considering either the account leverage or symbol-specific conditions.

#### `get_deviation`
Retrieves the current market deviation (spread) for the specified financial instrument.

#### `get_break_even`
Calculates the break-even level for a trade in points.

#### `is_risk_ok`
Checks whether the current risk level is within the predefined maximum risk limit.

### Examples
To utilize the `RiskManagement` class, first initialize it with the required parameters:
```python
risk_manager = RiskManagement(
        symbol="EURUSD", 
        max_risk=5.0, 
        daily_risk=2.0, 
        max_trades=10, 
        std_stop=True, 
        account_leverage=True, 
        start_time="09:00", 
        finishing_time="17:00", 
        time_frame="1h"
)
```

You can
 then use the provided methods to manage risk for your trading activities:
```python
# Calculate risk level
risk_level = risk_manager.risk_level()

# Get appropriate lot size for a trade
lot_size = risk_manager.get_lot()

# Determine stop loss and take profit levels
stop_loss = risk_manager.get_stop_loss()
take_profit = risk_manager.get_take_profit()

# Check if current risk is acceptable
is_risk_acceptable = risk_manager.is_risk_ok()
```

This class offers a structured approach to incorporating risk management into automated trading strategies on the MetaTrader 5 platform.
