# Risk Models

The `risk_models` module provides a framework for implementing risk management strategies in financial markets. It is designed to help users make informed decisions regarding permissible trades under current market conditions and effectively allocate assets to optimize the risk-reward ratio.

## Overview

This module consists of abstract and concrete classes that encapsulate the core principles of risk management. It offers a structured approach to evaluate market conditions and manage asset allocation, crucial for minimizing potential losses without significantly reducing the potential for gains.

## Components

### Abstract Base Class: `RiskModel`

The `RiskModel` class serves as an abstract base for other risk management models. It defines the essential structure that all derived models must follow, focusing on two key areas:

- **Trade Permission**: Determines which trades are permissible based on the analysis of current market conditions and the risk profile of the portfolio.
- **Asset Allocation**: Defines how assets should be allocated across the portfolio to maintain an optimal balance between risk and return.

### Concrete Implementation: `HMMRiskManager`

The `HMMRiskManager` class is a concrete implementation of the `RiskModel` class, utilizing Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to manage market risks. It identifies market trends and decides on permissible trading actions, facilitating a risk-aware trading strategy. Features include:

- Modeling financial market's hidden states using Gaussian HMM.
- Identifying bullish and bearish market trends for informed trading decisions.
- Customizable parameters for model fitting and market data analysis.

## Usage

To implement a new risk management model within this framework:

1. **Extend the `RiskModel` class**: Define your model by extending the abstract base class and implementing the `which_trade_allowed` and `which_quantity_allowed` methods.
2. **Instantiate and use your model**: Create an instance of your model and use it to analyze market conditions, identify permissible trades, and decide on asset allocation.

## Future Expansions

This module is designed with extensibility in mind. Future models can be seamlessly integrated by following the established structure, ensuring a consistent approach to risk management across different strategies.
