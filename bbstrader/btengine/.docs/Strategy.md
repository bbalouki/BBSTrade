# Strategy
A Strategy object encapsulates all calculation on market data that generate advisory signals to a Portfolio object. Thus all of the "strategy logic" resides within this class. We opted to separate out the Strategy and Portfolio objects for this backtester, since we believe this is more amenable to the situation of multiple strategies feeding "ideas" to a larger Portfolio, which then can handle its own risk (such as sector allocation, leverage). In higher frequency trading, the strategy and portfolio concepts will be tightly coupled and extremely hardware dependent.

At this stage in the event-driven backtester development there is no concept of an indicator or filter, such as those found in technical trading. These are also good candidates for creating a class hierarchy.

The strategy hierarchy is relatively simple as it consists of an abstract base class with a single pure virtual method for generating SignalEvent objects. In order to create the Strategy hierarchy it is necessary to import NumPy, pandas, the Queue object (which has become queue in Python 3), abstract base class tools and the SignalEvent:
