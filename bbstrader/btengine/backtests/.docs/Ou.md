# OUBacktester Strategy with Hidden Markov Model Risk Management

The `OUBacktester` is a robust framework designed to execute backtesting on financial markets using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting model combined with risk management through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This document provides detailed insights into the implementation, usage, and integration of the `OUBacktester` within a backtesting ecosystem.

## Overview

The `OUBacktester` extends a generic `Strategy` class, leveraging the OU process to identify and exploit mean-reverting characteristics in financial time series. This strategy is particularly tailored to historical market data, aiming to generate signals for a single or multiple financial instruments.

Key components of the backtesting framework include:

- **Data Handling**: Integration with `HistoricCSVDataHandler` for market data ingestion.
- **Signal Generation**: Utilizes the `OrnsteinUhlenbeck` and `HMMRiskManager` for signal and risk management.
- **Event Management**: Incorporates `SignalEvent` for signal broadcasting.
- **Execution Handling**: Employs `SimulatedExecutionHandler` for order execution simulation.

## Strategy Configuration

The `OUBacktester` class requires initialization with market data (`bars`), an event queue (`events`), and optional parameters that define strategy behavior:

- `ticker`: Symbol of the financial instrument.
- `p`: Lookback period for the OU process.
- `n`: Minimum number of observations for signal generation.
- `qty`: Quantity of assets to trade.
- `csvfile`: Path to the CSV file containing historical market data.
- `model`: HMM risk management model.
- `window`: Lookback period for HMM.

### Data Reading Function

- `_read_csv`: Reads market data from CSV into a DataFrame, indexing by date and parsing columns specific to market prices and volume.

### Signal Creation

- `create_signal`: Generates trading signals based on the OU process outcomes and HMM risk management decisions. It manages transitions between LONG and SHORT states and exits from positions as dictated by strategy logic and market conditions.

## Execution Function

`run_ou_backtest` facilitates the initialization and execution of the backtest using provided parameters:

- `symbol_list`: Symbols to trade.
- `backtest_csv`: Path to the backtesting CSV.
- `ou_csv`: CSV for the OU model.
- `hmm_csv`: CSV for the HMM model.
- `start_date`: Beginning of the backtesting period.
- `initial_capital`: Starting capital.
- `heartbeat`: Frequency of market data processing.

This function orchestrates the backtesting process by setting up the data handler, execution handler, portfolio, and integrating the `OUBacktester` strategy with HMM risk management.

## Example Usage

To execute a backtest for the `GLD` symbol using specific data sources and strategy parameters:

```python
import datetime
from bbstrader.tseries.arch import load_and_prepare_data
# Path to data directories
csv_dir = '/backtests/results/ou_hmm/'
ou_csv = '/backtests/results/ou_hmm/ou_gld_train.csv'
hmm_csv = '/backtests/results/ou_hmm/hmm_gld_train.csv'
symbol_list = ['GLD']

# Strategy parameters
kwargs = {
    "tiker": 'GLD',
    'n': 5,
    'p': 5,
    'qty': 2000,
    "window": 50,
    'strategy_name': 'Ornstein-Uhlenbeck & HMM'
}

# Backtest period
start_date = datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 2)

# Execute backtest
run_ou_backtest(symbol_list, csv_dir, ou_csv, hmm_csv, start_date, **kwargs)
```

## Notes

- For effectiveness, it's crucial that the `hmm_csv` data covers a period preceding the `backtest_csv` dataset to prevent look-ahead bias and ensure the integrity of the HMM's risk management.

- By default all bcktests uses Hidden Markov model as risk manager  , if you want to not use it , you can do so by adjusting the `OUBacktester` and `run_ou_backtest`.
In the future we will give option to use different risk manager.

- This strategy is optimized for assets that exhibit mean reversion characteristics. Prior to executing this backtest, it is imperative to conduct a mean reversion test on the intended asset to ensure its suitability for this approach.
It's important to understand that mean reversion is a theory suggesting that asset prices and returns eventually move back towards the mean or average. This concept can be applied to various financial instruments, including stocks, bonds, and currencies. Here's a more detailed explanation on how to test for mean reversion:
1. Statistical Methods
a. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:
The ADF test is a common statistical test used to determine if a time series is stationary, which is a prerequisite for mean reversion. It tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series sample. If the test statistic is less than the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the series is stationary and possibly mean-reverting.

b. Hurst Exponent:
The Hurst exponent measures the autocorrelation of a time series and its tendency to revert to the mean. A Hurst exponent close to 0.5 suggests a random walk (non-mean reverting), less than 0.5 indicates mean reversion, and greater than 0.5 suggests a trending market.

2. Visual Inspection
a. Moving Averages:
Plotting short-term and long-term moving averages can provide a visual indication of mean reversion. If the asset price frequently crosses over its moving averages, it may suggest mean-reverting behavior.

b. Mean and Standard Deviation:
Plotting the mean and standard deviation bands around the price can also provide visual cues. If the price regularly oscillates around the mean and returns within the standard deviation bands, it may indicate mean reversion.

3. Quantitative Models
a. Cointegration Tests:
For pairs trading or multiple assets, cointegration tests can identify whether a linear combination of the assets is mean-reverting, even if the individual assets themselves are not.

b. Mean-Reverting Time Series Models:
Implementing models like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or AR(1) (Autoregressive Model) can help in identifying mean reversion. These models quantify the speed of mean reversion and the volatility of the asset around its mean.

Practical Steps:
Collect Data: Gather historical price data for the asset in question.
Preprocess Data: Ensure the data is clean and adjusted for dividends and splits.
Statistical Testing: Apply the ADF test and calculate the Hurst exponent for the data series.
Model Fitting: For a more sophisticated analysis, fit a mean-reverting model to the data and estimate its parameters.
Backtesting: After identifying mean reversion, backtest the strategy on historical data to check its viability before live implementation.

## Conclusion

The `OUBacktester` framework provides a comprehensive approach for backtesting trading strategies based on mean-reversion and sophisticated risk management through HMM. By adhering to this documentation, users can effectively configure and execute backtests to evaluate the performance of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in conjunction with HMM risk management across different financial instruments and market conditions.
